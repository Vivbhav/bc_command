Currently as on 18th October, only the comparison and addition functions are working properly. 
Very shortly from now, I will also finsish writing the subtraction, multiplication and division functions as well for arbirary precision floating point numbers (obviously including negative numbers also.)

After completing this I will write code to evaluate infix, and postfix expressions. Further, I will also write code for the evaluation of the exponent function and other trigonometric functions like sine, cosine, tangent, etc. 

Further the code will also add features of Inverse Trigonometric Functions like arcsin, arccosine, etc. and also deal with change of base for providing input and giving output. 

The addition of all these features will then make the project almost equivalent to the bc command operational on Linux.

For complex calculations, many a times we can see that the size of numbers used is far larger than the range of signed or unsigned integers, floats and doubles in C. Thus, there is a need for programs which can perform arithmetic operations with arbitrary precision on any given numbers.

This project is one such attempt to write a program which computes with arbitrary precision. This project has many functions like addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. ALong with that, the codes also support operations like comparison, logical operations, modulus function, etc all of these too, with arbitrary precision. 

This project is thus in it's complete sense one big step towards huge libraries which can support many more functions as well for such large numbers.
